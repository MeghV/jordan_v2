							<h2>VIP Artist Meet &amp; Greet</h2>
							<p>November 25, 2014 - Concert promos are designed to give guests an all-access experience from their front door, to the concert and back.  Uber provides transportation to/from the event.  We’ve offered UberBLACK, SUV, as well as stretch limos.  Uber New York has run a promo with a chopper from Manhattan to the Hamptons.  We can explore all creative options for getting winners to concerts venues.
<br><br>
The promo with Sam Lachow gave one fan the chance to win (+3) tickets and backstage at the concert, pizza with the artist and crew, and an afterparty limousine ride around Seattle with the artist and friends.  Uber organized the partners and worked in conjunction with Sam’s management team on logistics.  For a similar concert promo, Uber would create a URL - splash page, that contained all info on how fans could enter to win the promo.
